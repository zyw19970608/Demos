We conducted experiments on the cheetah-run task using human preference-based reinforcement learning with QPA and PPE. 
We invited two volunteers to assist with these experiments.
To differentiate, we labeled the experiments with the numbers '1' and '2'.
The final performance of the experiments is recorded in video files prefixed with 'human_'.
Additionally, we recorded the content of the last query selection in MP4 files prefixed with 'query_'.
